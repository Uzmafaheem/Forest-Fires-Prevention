# Forest-Fires-Prevention
# 🌲 Forest Fires Risk Analysis and Prediction
## 📌 Project Overview

Wildfires are highly unpredictable and can cause widespread environmental and economic damage. To support wildfire risk reduction by analyzing past fire occurrences and predicting high-risk areas. This project leverages the Forest Fires dataset to uncover patterns, build predictive models, and provide actionable recommendations to aid in risk mitigation.

## 🎯 Objectives

Analyze environmental and geographic factors influencing fire size and severity.

Develop models to predict high-risk areas.

Provide recommendations to optimize resource allocation and preventive measures.

## 🔍 Key Focus Areas

1. Data Understanding & Preprocessing

Explore dataset structure.

Handle missing values and inconsistencies.

Transform and normalize variables where necessary.

2. Feature Selection & Engineering for Regression

Identify relevant predictors (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall).

Handle multicollinearity.

Create engineered features or interaction terms to improve model performance.

3. Model Selection & Performance Evaluation

Train multiple regression models.

Evaluate using statistical metrics (R², RMSE, MAE).

Validate assumptions with residual diagnostics.

4. Regularization Techniques

Apply Ridge and Lasso Regression to address overfitting and multicollinearity.

Compare performance and interpret trade-offs.

5. Classification Task

Convert fire size into a binary target variable (e.g., small vs. large fire).

Train a Logistic Regression model.

Evaluate predictive performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

7. Final Interpretation & Decision-Making

Synthesize insights from both regression and classification models.

Recommend the most effective predictive approach.

Provide strategic recommendations for risk mitigation.
